Nexus is quite a ambitious project, and I am very excited to share more about it with you. In this post, I will be discussing abot its features, goals and license of Nexus.
## Features

There is essentially two diffrent types of features for nexus Core and Extended

### Core Features
The core features of nexus are the basic features that are required for nexus to function and work properly and these features are each developed in phases and are as follows:

1. The Underlying Network

    - Basic Connection between nodes
    - Message Type
    - A Routing System
    - Discovery Systen
    - SPIN Protocol (Structure Preservation In Network)
    - Pools



2. Cryptography

    1. Universal Identitys
    2. Presistance Network
    3. Authentication & Encryption

3. Orchestrator Server

    1. API Server (to interact with the network)

## Goals

The goal with project nexus is quite simple, make the web open and free for everyone to use and to make it so that no one can control the web and to make it so that the web is not controlled by a single entity or group of entities and allow for a truly free internet with everyone having the same rights and no one having more power than anyone else and taking equal part in sustaining the web.

## License

Nexus is licensed a costum license called the nexus license based on the carbon license and will be relased in its full form when the project is ready for public use and open sourced
